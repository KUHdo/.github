## :cow:  What does KUHdo do? 
We're developing software solutions for european **dairy farmers**.  
We enable the dairy farmers to hedge their raw milk at the european engery exchange with the dairy commodity futures.
This is the only instrument the farmer can use to stabilize his milk price.  
As this is a complex process we support our dairy farmers from the beginning till the settlement.  
We help them to calculate their company key production indicators and set them in relation to the actual tradable commodity prices.  
Another difficulty for the farmer is that is some cases it is needful to trade the future contracts of butter and skimmed milk powder which are subsitutes for raw milk.
As spoken we also help out in that cases. All in all we have the vision to distribute hedging knowledge to the dairy farmers in the language they speak.
